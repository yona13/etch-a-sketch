Odin Fundamentals Project 4 - Etch-a-Sketch

 - Grid will generate and can be resized by clicking the pen button at the top right
 - size limit is set to 100, though more reasonable sizes are between 12 to 36
 - Hovering over a grid will cause it to change colour
 - Button to the right of hex (shuffle button) will randomise the colour of the cell as the mouse passses over it
 - Button to the right of that (double arrows up) will cause the cells to start to darken by 10% on each passover
 - The final button reverts the grid to normal (i.e. hovering will show one colour, grid size as chosen by user)
